# Rock Paper Scissors - Console Game

## üìù Description
A straightforward, console-based version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, built with vanilla JavaScript. Test your luck against the computer directly in your browser's developer console! This is my first JS project, and frankly, it wasn't the worst. 
Rust is still my baby though.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Logic

This project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts through:

* **Basic Setup:** An HTML file linked to an external JavaScript file.
* **Computer's Choice (`getComputerChoice`):** Logic to make the computer randomly select "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
* **Player's Input (`getHumanChoice`):** Using `prompt()` to get the human player's choice.
* **Score Management:** Variables to keep track of both player and computer scores.
* **Round Logic (`playRound`):** Determining the winner of each round, accounting for case-insensitive player input, and updating scores.
* **Game Orchestration (`playGame`):** Managing a series of 5 rounds (can be tweaked in the <script> tag)
